WORK STILL IN PROGRESS
:construction:     :construction:

- *MVVM architecture* + *Domain layer* + *Repository pattern* to stay clean (as possible!)
- DI using *Hilt* :syringe:
- *Retrofit* to easily manage API calls :phone: (allo?)
- Unit tests using *Mockk*, *AssertK*, and *Turbine*, just to make sure everything's fine :suspect:
- Kover for test coverage (use command ./gradlew koverHtmlReportDebug to generate test report!)

(sorry for the emoji overload... but I mean come on, how cute is that tiger? :tiger:)
