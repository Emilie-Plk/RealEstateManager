# RealEstateManager
## A realestate management app designed for realtors

### Presentation
**RealEstateManager** is an Android app tailored for real estate agents, offering them the possibility of creating and editing new properties, listing them in a list or on a map, and also fitering them to find the perfect villa fitting customers' needs. You'll also find a loan simulator, how convenient!

If the internet connectivity is fussing, no worries: you can save your property form and it'll be accessible.

The app is supported in France and US so far. Currency rate is updated every 4h for better precision for conversion $ <-> €

### Tech stack
* Written in `Kotlin`, the star of the show
* `MVVM architecture` + `Domain layer` + `Repository pattern` to stay clean an organized (as possible!)
* `Room` for a robust, local data access with use of SQLite power! 
* DI using `Hilt` :syringe:
* `Retrofit` to easily manage API calls :phone: (allo?)
* Unit tests using `Mockk` and `Turbine`, just to make sure everything's fine :suspect:
* `Kover` for test coverage (use command `./gradlew koverHtmlReportDebug` to generate test report!) with ~60% branch coverage
